        <h2>What is Charity Miles and what does it do?</h2>
            <p>Charity Miles is an iPhone and Android app that helps you turn all the miles you walk, run and bike anyway into money for charity.</p>

        <h2>How does it track my miles?</h2>
            <p>The app uses your phone’s internal pedometer and GPS to track your distance.</p>
            <p>On iPhones, it syncs with your Apple Health app to automatically pull all of the steps and miles recorded by your phone.  This means that any fitness tracking devices connected to your Apple Health app will thereby sync to Charity Miles.</p>
            <p>On Android phones, it syncs with your phone’s internal pedometer.  There are many different models of Android phones, and Android operating systems.  Therefore, they each have different ways of doing this.  However, most of the popular Android phones will automatically send their pedometer miles to Charity Miles.</p>
